## Access Control Entries (ACEs)

There are `three` main types of ACEs that can be applied to all securable objects in AD:

|**ACE**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Access denied ACE`|Used within a DACL to show that a user or group is explicitly denied access to an object|
|`Access allowed ACE`|Used within a DACL to show that a user or group is explicitly granted access to an object|
|`System audit ACE`|Used within a SACL to generate audit logs when a user or group attempts to access an object. It records whether access was granted or not and what type of access occurred|
Each ACE is made up of the following `four` components:

1. The security identifier (SID) of the user/group that has access to the object (or principal name graphically)
2. A flag denoting the type of ACE (access denied, allowed, or system audit ACE)
3. A set of flags that specify whether or not child containers/objects can inherit the given ACE entry from the primary or parent object
4. An [access mask](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-dtyp/7a53f60e-e730-4dfe-bbe9-b21b62eb790b?redirectedfrom=MSDN) which is a 32-bit value that defines the rights granted to an object
## Why are ACEs Important?
